# Mathematical thinking for computer science
Why is this course important? (Directly from Coursera website) "_Mathematical thinking is crucial in all areas of computer science: algorithms, bioinformatics, computer graphics, data science, machine learning, etc. In this course, we will learn the most important tools used in discrete mathematics: induction, recursion, logic, invariants, examples, optimality. We will use these tools to answer typical programming questions like: How can we be certain a solution exists? Am I sure my program computes the optimal answer? Do each of these objects meet the given requirements?_"

## Week 1: Making convincing arguments

## Week 2: How to find an example

See Colab Notebook in folder to compute the number of solutions for the 8 queens puzzle.
